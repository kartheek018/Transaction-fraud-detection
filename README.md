# Transaction-fraud-detection
This project focuses on detecting online transaction fraud using machine learning techniques. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection, we identify key features for model training. After preprocessing, including label encoding, we train multiple machine learning models. The Random Forest Classifier emerges as the most effective, achieving a 99.94% accuracy rate. Detailed evaluation metrics, including confusion matrix analysis, highlight the model's performance in detecting fraudulent transactions. Our findings underscore the importance of robust fraud detection algorithms in safeguarding online transactions..
